The Last Plan is : 
STEPS :
INITIAL-STATE()   -> GOALS()   -> PUT-DOWN(ob: a)   -> STACK(sob: b,sunderob: a)   -> UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)   -> PICK-UP(ob1: b)   -> 
Links :

            PUT-DOWN(ob: a)   -> GOALS()  for state : ON-TABLE(ob1: a)  
            STACK(sob: b,sunderob: a)   -> GOALS()  for state : CLEAR(sob: b)  
            UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)   -> PUT-DOWN(ob: a)  for state : HOLDING(ob: a)  
            PICK-UP(ob1: b)   -> STACK(sob: b,sunderob: a)  for state : HOLDING(sob: b)  
            INITIAL-STATE()   -> STACK(sob: b,sunderob: a)  for state : CLEAR(sunderob: a)  
            INITIAL-STATE()   -> UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)  for state : CLEAR(sob: a)   and ARM-EMPTY()   and ON(sob: a , sunderob: b)  
            UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)   -> PICK-UP(ob1: b)  for state : CLEAR(ob1: b)  
            INITIAL-STATE()   -> PICK-UP(ob1: b)  for state : ARM-EMPTY()   and ON-TABLE(ob1: b)  
ORDERING :
            INITIAL-STATE(()  ) -> GOALS(()  )
one of solution is 


INITIAL-STATE()  
INITIAL-STATE()  
INITIAL-STATE()  
UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)  
UNSTACK(sob: a,sunderob: b)  
PICK-UP(ob1: b)
